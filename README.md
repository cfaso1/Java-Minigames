# Minigames 🎮

This repository contains a collection of **classic games** recreated in **Java** using the [Doodlepad](http://doodlepad.org/) graphics library.  
These projects were originally built as part of my **AP Computer Science class in high school** and later refined for learning and practice.


## 🕹️ Included Games
- **Wordle** – the classic word guessing game
- **Connect Four** – drop pieces to connect four in a row
- **Snake** – grow your snake while avoiding collisions
- **Minesweeper** – uncover safe squares, avoid mines
- **Othello** – flip opponent’s pieces and control the board
- **Piano Tiles** – test your reaction time by clicking falling tiles


## ⚙️ Technologies
- **Java (JDK 8+)**
- **Doodlepad library** for graphics and input


## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/cfaso1/minigames.git
   cd minigames
   ```
- Make sure you have Java JDK 8 or newer installed: `java -version`
- Open the project in VS Code (or your IDE of choice).
- Ensure you have the Doodlepad JAR added to your classpath.
- You can download it from doodlepad.org
- Run the main class of the game you want to play, for example:
    ```
    javac connectfour/ConnectFour.java
    java connectfour.ConnectFour
    ```

## 📚 Learning Goals
These games were built to practice:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Event handling with mouse and keyboard
- Game loop and rendering basics
- Problem-solving and algorithm design
